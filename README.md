# CampKeen-SBC-Linux

A holding place for all the stuff needed to make an SBC embedded linux console for CampKeen. I think i'm going to structure this in the following way. All the stuff needed to make any Linux box able to communicate with CampKeen and display status. and then all the stuff needed to make an image with yocto or buildroot. along with image releases for that. these will be small images because if you want more than the image then well you need to learn and add the extra stuff or just use a PI and use the other stuff. This may lead to a PyPi package for campkeen.
